creational design pattern,
only one instance
easy global access
control how instantiated
any critical region must be entered serially, think thread safety issues
loggers, caching, database conections
indications: control access to a shared resource
contraindications you dont want global access for everything, singleton hides dependancies, harder to read code

consider lazy construction, only created when first needed

eager loading necessary if needed to be ready and loaded fast

thread safety, critacal section must be locked



get_instance()<--- Hint its a singleton class vs constructor

consistent usage
flexibility and easy modification of initialization logic
ease of expanding the setup and initialization of code
better flow than a constrctor

Thread safe implementation ---> Python thread safety must be taken into account
If multiple threads try to create or access Singleton object at the same time,
it can lead to race conditions, this can cause difficult to debug behavior.
Dont always have to create a thread safe Singleton, but in some cases its important.
