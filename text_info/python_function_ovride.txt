 first step in instantiation process. typically overridden when you need to control
 the object creation process

__init__
 instance method responsible for initializing objects attributes after is has been created
 by __new__. __init__ method doesnt resturn a value and is called automatically
 after the object is created. This method is typically overridden to define custom
 atttribute initialization for the class

__call__
 instance method that allows a class's instances to be called as if they were functions

Metaclass

 __new__
 since a metaclass is a class that creates other classes, __new__ in a metaclass is responsible
 for creating and returing new class object

__init__
 responsible for initializing the new class object created by the metaclass, such as setting
 class attributed or other class level properties

__call__
 allows instances of the metaclass(objects themselves) to br called as they were functions
 executed when CREATING INSTANCES OF THE CLASSES CREATED BY THE MEATACLASS. By customizing this
 method you can control how instances of thoses classes are created or returned
